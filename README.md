# Chess Position Evaluator  

This project captures a chessboard from a screenshot, extracts its FEN (Forsythâ€“Edwards Notation) representation, and uses Stockfish to suggest the best move. It also includes plans for automatic move execution and a graphical user interface (GUI).  

## Features  
âœ… Captures the chessboard image using a double-click  
âœ… Extracts the FEN from the image via [Chessify](https://chessify.me)  
âœ… Automatically flips the board if playing as Black  
âœ… Uses Stockfish to suggest the best move  
ðŸ›  **Upcoming Features:**  
  - **Auto Move Execution**: Automatically make the best move in the game  
  - **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: A user-friendly interface instead of the terminal  

## Prerequisites  
Ensure you have the following installed:  

- Python 12+  
- `requests` (`pip install requests`)  
- `pynput` (`pip install pynput`)  
- `mss` (`pip install mss`) (For X11-based systems)  
- `grim` (For Wayland-based systems, install via package manager)  
- Stockfish chess engine ([Download here](https://stockfishchess.org/))  

## Installation  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OTAKUWeBer/AutoChessBot.git
cd AutoChessBot
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

```bash
# If you use Wayland (e.g., Sway, Hyprland):
sudo pacman -S grim
```

## Usage  
1. **Run the script:**  
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```  

2. **Choose your color when prompted:**  
   - Enter `1` if playing as White  
   - Enter `2` if playing as Black  

3. **Double-click on the chessboard in your game to capture a screenshot.**  

4. The script will:  
   - Extract the FEN  
   - Flip the board if necessary  
   - Get the best move from Stockfish  

5. The best move will be displayed in the terminal.  

### (Planned) Auto Move Execution  
Once implemented, the bot will automatically play the best move in your game.  

### (Planned) Graphical User Interface  
A GUI will replace the terminal-based interaction, making the tool more user-friendly.  

## Configuration  
You need to provide a session ID for Chessify in `getfen.py`:  
```python
cookies = {
    "session_id": "your_chessify_session_id_here"
}
```
